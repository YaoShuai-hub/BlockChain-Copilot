# Skills Directory Structure

## Overview

BlockChain-Copilot now has **two** skills directories:

```
BlockChain-Copilot/
├── skills/              # System skills (pre-built, tested)
│   ├── token-price/
│   ├── wallet-balance/
│   ├── swap-tokens/
│   ├── transfer-tokens/
│   ├── energy-rental/
│   ├── address-risk-checker/
│   ├── address-book/
│   ├── address-profiling/
│   ├── approval-scanner/
│   ├── token-security/
│   ├── transaction-simulator/
│   └── skill-generator/    # Meta-skill that creates new skills!
│
└── personal-skills/     # User-generated skills (auto-created)
    ├── README.md
    ├── .gitignore       # Prevents committing generated skills
    └── [generated-skills]/
```

## System Skills (`skills/`)

**What they are:**
- Pre-built by developers
- Production-ready and tested
- Version controlled in git
- Updated via code releases

**Examples:**
- `token-price` - Get real-time token prices
- `wallet-balance` - Check wallet balances
- `transfer-tokens` - Send TRX/TRC20 tokens
- `skill-generator` - Create new skills!

## Personal Skills (`personal-skills/`)

**What they are:**
- Auto-generated by the AI agent
- Created based on user requirements
- User-managed (not in git by default)
- Can be regenerated/modified/deleted

**How they're created:**
1. User asks for functionality not covered by system skills
2. `skill-generator` creates a planning document
3. User reviews and approves
4. AI generates the skill code
5. Saved to `personal-skills/[skill-name]/`

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "我想查询NFT持有情况"

Agent: [Generates planning for 'nft-holder-checker']
        ↓
       [User approves]
        ↓
       [Creates skill in personal-skills/nft-holder-checker/]
        ↓
       [Skill ready to use!]
```

## Priority and Overrides

When discovering skills:
1. **System skills loaded first** (from `skills/`)
2. **Personal skills loaded second** (from `personal-skills/`)

If a personal skill has the same name as a system skill:
→ **Personal skill takes priority** (overrides system skill)

This allows you to customize system behavior!

## File Structure Comparison

### System Skill Example
```
skills/token-price/
├── SKILL.md              # Documentation
├── scripts/
│   ├── fetch_price.py    # Main logic
│   └── helpers.py
├── references/
│   └── api_docs.md
└── tests/
    └── test_fetch_price.py
```

### Personal Skill Example
```
personal-skills/nft-holder-checker/
├── SKILL.md              # Auto-generated docs
├── scripts/
│   └── main.py          # Auto-generated code
└── metadata.json        # Marks as generated
```

## Management Commands

### List all skills
```python
from src.skill_discovery import list_all_skill_names

skills = list_all_skill_names()
print("System:", skills['system'])
print("Personal:", skills['personal'])
```

### Delete a personal skill
```bash
rm -rf personal-skills/[skill-name]
```

### Regenerate a skill
Just ask the AI to create it again!

### Promote personal → system
If a personal skill becomes stable:
```bash
# 1. Move to system skills
mv personal-skills/my-skill skills/

# 2. Edit SKILL.md frontmatter
# Remove: generated: true
# Add proper: author, version

# 3. Add tests
mkdir skills/my-skill/tests

# 4. Commit to git
git add skills/my-skill
git commit -m "Promote my-skill to system skill"
```

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. ✅ Review generated code before using
2. ✅ Test personal skills thoroughly
3. ✅ Delete unused skills to keep clean
4. ✅ Provide feedback to AI for improvements

### For Developers
1. ✅ Keep system skills well-tested
2. ✅ Document APIs clearly
3. ✅ Follow Anthropic Skills specification
4. ✅ Version system skills properly

## Security Notes

- **System skills**: Reviewed and trusted
- **Personal skills**: Auto-generated, **review before use**
- **Git ignore**: Personal skills excluded by default
- **Metadata**: Generated skills clearly marked

See `personal-skills/README.md` for more details on auto-generated skills.
